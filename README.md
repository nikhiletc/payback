# Payback-task

## Steps to run local e2e test
  
- Pull the branch locally.
- Install dependency.
- in terminal type `npx playwright test --headed`

Added small github Action, after each push it will run the test.


#### Comments

- If we add attributes in front end then it will be very effective.
